CCSON is a [CSON](http://noe.mearie.org/cson/) library in C. 
It comes as a single file and has two functions, one that 
converts JSON text to CSON text and one that converts CSON 
text to JSON text.

## Requirements
* C11 compiler, with `stdtypes.h` and `uchar.h` 
standard headers. Tested successfully with MSVC and GCC.

## Example

```c
#define CSON_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "cson.h"

int main(void) {
    
    
    
}
```
